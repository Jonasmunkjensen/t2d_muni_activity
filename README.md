# Municipal Services and Physical Activity in Type 2 Diabetes

## Project Description

### Objective

The project aims to investigate the availability and utilization of municipal health services among people with type 2 diabetes, describe differences between participants and non-participants, assess potential selection bias, and analyze changes in self-reported physical activity over time.

### Project Components

#### Part 1 – Mapping
Objective: To investigate how many individuals have received municipal health services, based on the supplementary survey in autumn 2024.

#### Part 2 – Comparisons
Objective: To describe differences between participants and non-participants in municipal programs based on:

Variables from Health in Central Denmark (BMI, smoking, activity level, WHO-5, SF-1, PAID, health literacy, disease burden, diabetes duration, marital status, personality traits)

Variables from Statistics Denmark (HbA1c, cholesterol, comorbidity, socioeconomic status)

#### Part 3 – Attrition Analysis
Objective: To evaluate selection by comparing the supplementary survey with the overall Health in Central Denmark population.

#### Part 4 – Changes in Physical Activity
Objective: To analyze changes in self-reported physical activity from 2020 to 2024, and compare developments between participants and non-participants in municipal programs.

Physical activity categories (past year):

- Regular vigorous training/competitive sports several times per week
- Recreational sports/heavy gardening ≥ 4 hours per week
- Light physical activity (e.g., walking, cycling, light gardening) ≥ 4 hours per week
- Sedentary (e.g., reading, watching TV)
- Don’t know

#### Data Management and Analysis:

- Data will be processed in R-studio.
- Analyses will be conducted securely via GenomeDK.
- Training in GenomeDK is scheduled for September 25, 2025.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

- `data/`:
- `doc/`:
- `R/`:

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`t2d_muni_activity.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

documentation.
